  # Dynamic Pagination

  In this example you will learn how to create a dinamic, offset-based, pagination, i.e. how to paginate a list of items that DO support adding and removing an elements from the list.

  This example is a continuation of the *Static Pagination* topic and understanding the \`PaginationController\` component is a pre-requisite.

  As in the *Static Pagination* topic, we won't focuss on the detail, but rather on adding and removing and element from the list.
