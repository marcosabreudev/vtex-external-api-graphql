  # Static Pagination

  In this example you will learn how to create a static, offset-based, pagination, i.e. how to paginate a list of items that DO NOT support adding or removing an element from the list. If you want to know how to handle a list that do support adding and removing elements, please check the \`Dynamic Pagination\` topic

  This example is a classical list-detail problem, where there is a list rendered in rows. Each row, when clicked, takes the user to a details page where more info can be seen about the element.

  In this topic, we use the detail component of the prior topic and focus on the list pagination.
